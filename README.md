Project Overview
Forest fires are a significant environmental hazard, causing widespread damage to ecosystems and human settlements. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires can help in early warning and better management of forest resources. This project aims to build a predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of forest fires based on historical data.
